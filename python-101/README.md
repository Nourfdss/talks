# Community First: Overview of the Python Ecosystem

## Media

- [Slides](http://bit.ly/python-ecosystem-overview)

## Requirements

Download Divvy data used in `data-analysis.ipynb` from https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data

## Outline

- What is Python used for
  - applications of Python
    - web development
    - defacto choice of programming language for lots of science applications
    - great libraries to do data analysis
    - platforms such as Spark, CUDA (GPU programming), and Tensorflow have Python first-class support for Python with bidings to those platforms. You write Python code, it doesn't execute inside of the Python runtime, but it goes out somewhere else where faster libraries are able to do competition
    - great glue language for scripting
    - data engineering

- Live Code Applications
  - Data Analysis
    - Jupyter notebook environment
    - pandas... load large dataframe. do couple of group by operations to get results
    - seaborn.. tips set https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html
  - Scripting
  - Web Development

- Python Community
  - What can I say about the Python community that hasn't already been said
  - I came for the language, but I stay for the community - Brett Cannon (Python Core Development)
  - [ChiPy](https://www.chipy.org) is the local resource
    - 15 years of monthly meetings
    - Special Interest Groups (WebDev, Finance, Data, OpenSource)
    - [Mentorship Program](https://chipymentor.org/) (1-on-1)
    - Slack where we talk about projects
      - Get help
      - Talk about latest news
      - Work on problems together (advent of code)
    - ChiPy.org (if you take anything away)
    - [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/)
