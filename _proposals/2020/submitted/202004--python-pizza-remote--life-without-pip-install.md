## Abstract

The world has lost the ability to `pip install`... what do we do?!?! This talk explores a hypothetical Doomsday Scenario where the Python Package Index has gone offline. We examine three ways we can import libraries we have not installed.

After this talk, attendees will have a better understanding of what happens when a package is imported into Python.
