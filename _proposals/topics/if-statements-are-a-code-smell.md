## Elevator Pitch

`if` statements allow us to control what statements are executed. Code with too many `if` statements is hard to read and even harder to change. This talk will demonstrate how to refactor complex conditional logic with simple Python classes using a real-world example of Object-Oriented design.

## Description

`if` statements are elements of a programming language that allow us to control what statements are executed. By chaining together a series of `if` statements, we can solve any problem we can think of. But code with too many `if` statements is hard to read and even harder to change. Workarounds that once allowed us to move fast, now get in the way when we go in to make modifications. It doesnâ€™t have to be this way!

This talk demonstrates HOWTO handle complex conditional logic with simple Python classes. The material will be presented in the context of a code refactor for an open-source project: we examine the initial solution featuring duplicate `if` statements, show how hard it is to make a change, and walk through the process of refactoring `if` blocks into polymorphic classes. The case study has been simplified to illustrate concepts you can apply to your own code.

The session is geared towards beginner / intermediate developers who do not have a lot of experience designing Object-Oriented solutions. After this talk, you will be able to identify situations where Object-Oriented principles can be used to simplify complex conditional logic. Using the steps outlined, you will be able to refactor code to improve software design without changing existing functionality.

## Notes

I have presented this talk at PyCon US, PyCon Balkan,and PyOhio. The audience appreciated the use of a real-world code example to help solidify abstract object-oriented concepts.

On top of being a regular speaker in the Chicago tech community, I have also spoken at PyTennessee, PyTexas, and led a 3-hour tutorial at PyCon US. A selection of previous talks can be viewed here: https://bit.ly/siv-talks-playlist
