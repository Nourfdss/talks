# Testing from the Ground Up

Previous title, *The Art of Developer Testing*

## Description

We use tests to ensure our program works as intended and that changes to the codebase do not break existing functionality. Seasoned developers have experience balancing writing code to solve business problems versus writing tests to ensure correctness and prevent regression. Finding this balance and knowing what to test can feel more like an art than a science, especially to those new to the industry. This opinionated talk will demystify the Art of (Developer) Testing with a focus on best practices and tools that can be used to help you write effective tests more efficiently.
